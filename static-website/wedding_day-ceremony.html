					<span class="li">Sara Stevens with the First Reading: Ecclesiastes 4:9-13</span><br/>
					<span class="quote">(English Standard Version ESV) <b>Ecclesiastes 4</b> Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil. 10 For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up! 11 Again, if two lie together, they keep warm, but how can one keep warm alone? 12 And though a man might prevail against one who is alone, two will withstand him -a threefold cord is not quickly broken. 13 Better was a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who no longer knew how to take advice.</span><br/>
					<span class="li">Responsorial Psalm: Psalm 33:1, 4-5, 12, 18-19, 20, 22</span><br/>
					<span class="li">Celtic Alleluia</span><br/>
					<span class="li">Karen Warner with the Second Reading: Philippians 4:4-9</span><br/>
					<span class="quote">(New International Version NIV) <b>Philippians 4</b> Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! 5 Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near. 6 Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.7 And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. 8 Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things. 9 Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me—put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you.</span><br/>
					<span class="li">Fr. Richard Perfetto with The Gospel Reading: John 2:1-11</span><br/>
					<span class="quote">(Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition RSVCE) <b>John 2</b> On the third day there was a marriage at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there; 2 Jesus also was invited to the marriage, with his disciples.3 When the wine failed, the mother of Jesus said to him, <i>"They have no wine."</i>4 And Jesus said to her, <i>"O woman, what have you to do with me?[a] My hour has not yet come."</i> 5 His mother said to the servants, <i>"Do whatever he tells you."</i> 6 Now six stone jars were standing there, for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. 7 Jesus said to them, <i>"Fill the jars with water."</i> And they filled them up to the brim. 8 He said to them, <i>"Now draw some out, and take it to the steward of the feast."</i> So they took it. 9 When the steward of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the steward of the feast called the bridegroom 10 and said to him, <i>"Every man serves the good wine first; and when men have drunk freely, then the poor wine; but you have kept the good wine until now."</i> 11 This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed in him.</span><br/>
