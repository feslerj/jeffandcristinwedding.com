				<h1>Invitations are Out!</h1>
				<h2>March 9th 2016</h2>
				<p>
					<br/>
					Invitations are now out there, and we have been getting back some RSVPs. which is exciting! But we have also been receiving some questions, so hopefully anyone coming to the site can find the answers.  
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<span class="li">Everyone who has an invitation addressed to a single person gets a <b>plus one</b> guest. Please write your guest's name on the RSVP- it will make it easier for us to include them in the final count and have a table place card for them :).  If we get an RSVP back without any indication that you are bringing a guest, that's perfectly fine, but we'll assume you aren't bringing a guest if you haven't contacted us otherwise.</span><br/>
					<span class="li">Yes, we would like you to mail out the RSVPs :).  We will accomodate emails, texts, and phone calls to the best of our ability, but it makes it a lot easier for us if we get your RSVP card back- and it's fun getting them back in the mail as well!</span><br/>
					<span class="li">Please indicate any special food allergies or dietary restrictions on the RSVP card you send back to us, so that we can make the <a href="./wedding_day-reception.html">reception venue</a> aware in the final count.</span><br/>
					<br/>
					If there are any other questions, please feel free to <a href="mailto:jeffandcristin@gmail.com">contact us directly</a>.  Hope to see you all in April!

				<h1>Thank You for Two Wonderful Wedding Showers!</h1>
				<h2>February 29th 2016</h2>
				<p>
					<br/>
					Our family and friends in both Detroit, MI and Peoria, IL have both put on wonderful showers for us, and we want to thank everyone for the wonderful gifts so far!  We have lots of stuff and our registry is getting small, <a href="./honeymoon.html">so we're starting up a PayPal site</a> if our guests would like to contribute to our Australian/New Zealand Honeymoon, instead of a gift on the registry.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					We've heard the feedback and we've filled out the rest of the site with links that actually work and information that you can use for the wedding.  Invites are going out Monday, so hopefully everyone is looking at a mostly fully functional site!  Less than 2 months to go!
					<br/>
				</p>
				<h1>We have registered!</h1>
				<h2>December 20th 2015</h2>
				<p>
					<br/>
					Registry links are working, and there are more updates coming soon!
					<br/>
					Come back here for future updates!
					<br/>
